One of the most common questions in frontend development is: *Should I use Grid or Flexbox?*. The short answer is: **both**. They are not rivals; they are teammates.
## The Fundamental Difference
*   **Flexbox** is **one-dimensional**. It works best for distributing items in a single line (row) OR a single column.
*   **CSS Grid** is **two-dimensional**. It works for controlling rows AND columns simultaneously.
## Flexbox: King of Components
Use Flexbox when you want to align items within a container, like a navigation bar or a product card.
```css
.navbar {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between; /* Spacing */
  align-items: center; /* Vertical centering */
}
```
### When to choose Flexbox:
*   Aligning small groups of items.
*   Distributing space within a component.
*   If you only care about one direction (horizontal or vertical).
## CSS Grid: King of Layout
Use Grid when defining the overall structure of your page or a complex gallery.
```css
.layout {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 200px 1fr; /* Fixed sidebar, flexible content */
  grid-template-rows: auto 1fr auto; /* Header, Body, Footer */
  gap: 20px;
}
```
### When to choose Grid:
*   Creating the main layout structure (Header, Sidebar, Main, Footer).
*   2D image galleries.
*   When you need to overlap items (`z-index` in cells).
## The Power of Combining Them
The most common pattern in 2024 is using **Grid for the skeleton** of the page and **Flexbox for the cells** (the individual components).
```css
/* Main Layout */
body { display: grid; ... }
/* Card Component inside the Grid */
.card { display: flex; flex-direction: column; }
```
Mastering both is essential for any modern frontend developer. Stop using `float` and `tables` and embrace the future!

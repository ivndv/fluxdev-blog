Since version 16.8, React introduced **Hooks**, forever changing how we write components. We no longer need classes to handle state or lifecycle methods.
## useState: Component Memory
`useState` is the Hook that lets a component "remember" information.
```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';
function Counter() {
  // [currentState, updateFunction]
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
      You clicked {count} times
    </button>
  );
}
```
### Golden Rules:
1.  Only call Hooks at the top level (not inside loops or conditions).
2.  Only call Hooks from React function components.
## useEffect: Synchronizing with External Systems
`useEffect` handles "side effects": API calls, subscriptions, timers, or manual DOM manipulation.
```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
function Clock() {
  const [time, setTime] = useState(new Date());
  useEffect(() => {
    // Runs on mount
    const timer = setInterval(() => setTime(new Date()), 1000);
    // Cleanup function (runs on unmount)
    return () => clearInterval(timer);
  }, []); // [] means "run only once on mount"
  return <h2>It is: {time.toLocaleTimeString()}</h2>;
}
```
## Dependency Array
The second argument of `useEffect` is crucial:
*   `[]`: Runs only on mount (like `componentDidMount`).
*   `[prop]`: Runs on mount AND when `prop` changes.
*   *(No argument)*: Runs on EVERY render (Careful!).
Mastering these two hooks is 90% of modern React work. Practice with them before jumping into complex hooks like `useContext` or `useReducer`!

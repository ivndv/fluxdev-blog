Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. It is the standard on GitHub (`README.md`), technical blogs, and documentation.
## The Basics
### Headers
Use hashes (`#`) for titles:
`# H1` -> Main Title
`## H2` -> Subtitle
`### H3` -> Section
### Emphasis
*   **Bold**: `**Text**` or `__Text__`
*   *Italic*: `*Text*` or `_Text_`
*   ~~Strikethrough~~: `~~Text~~`
### Lists
**Unordered:**
```markdown
* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Sub-item
```
**Ordered:**
```markdown
1. First step
2. Second step
```
## Code
For inline code use backticks: \`const a = 1;\`.
For code blocks use three backticks:
\`\`\`javascript
function hello() {
  console.log("World");
}
\`\`\`
## Links and Images
*   **Link**: `[Text](https://url.com)`
*   **Image**: `![Alt Text](/path/image.png)`
## Blockquotes
> "Code is poetry executed by machines."
Use `>` at the beginning of the line.
Markdown is incredibly simple yet powerful. Converting plain text to rich HTML without touching a single `<div>` tag is a superpower every dev should have.
